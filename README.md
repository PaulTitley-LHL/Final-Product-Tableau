# Final-Project-Tableau

For an alternative way of viewing the project, I've also uploaded the story of the dashboards here:

## Project/Goals
To analyze and interpret data from the Airbnb dataset and attempt to make some insights of potential relationships within. Namely if the average price and review scores of each New York borough can be explained within the data provided.

## Process
1. Load the data, see what data types I have access to
2. Clean data via filters
3. Perform EDA on available data
4. Determined that average price and review score would likely be the most actionable business data.
5. Attempt to explain potential relationships of the price and score data with dashboards.

## Results
I went with Option 2 for my project, specifically the Airbnb dataset.

First page: I used a Gantt visualization to display the clustering of account creation dates for each borough and property type, to visualize where the majorities lied.

Second and third: I used map visualizations with togglable filters to break down how each borough ranked in average price and review score.

Fourth and fifth: Used a combination of line, bars and tree visualizations to break down what controlled the average and which data might be a factor in affecting the numbers for each borough.

## Challenges 
1. Forecasting data didn't seem possible since I didn't have access to booking data for each property, or potential price changes.
2. Some of the data wasn't relevant, or was incorrectly labeled.
3. Zip codes specifically needed to be cleaned in order to perform proper EDA on each borough.

## Future Goals
If I had more time I'd like to see a data set that was more current to see if there was a potential shift due to the pandemic. I also would've liked more access to some historical data for each location in order to get a better understanding how successful each location is.
